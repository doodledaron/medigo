## Demo Steps

With Medigo‚Äôs **voice assistant** and **checkpoint-based navigation + queueing system**, Uncle Tan:

1. Uses the **Medigo Voice Assistant** to describe his symptoms.  
2. Gets matched to the **correct hospital, department, and doctor**.  
3. Navigates effortlessly to the **right department using NFC checkpoints**.  
4. Checks the **real-time queue length** before even arriving.

**Medigo** is your **personal assistant in your pocket** that:
1. Understands your **symptoms**  
2. Directs you to the **right department & doctor**  
3. Finds **nearby hospitals** with travel distances  
4. Navigates inside the hospital via **NFC checkpoints**  
5. Shows **live queue status** so you know wait time in advance
